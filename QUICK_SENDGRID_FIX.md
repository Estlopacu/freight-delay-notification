# Quick SendGrid Setup - Fix 403 Forbidden Error

## Current Issue

You're getting a **403 Forbidden** error, which means one of these issues:
1. ‚ùå API key is invalid/expired
2. ‚ùå API key doesn't have correct permissions
3. ‚ùå Sender email (`estlopacu@gmail.com`) is not verified

## Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Verify Your Sender Email

1. **Go to SendGrid Sender Verification**:
   ```
   https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth/senders
   ```

2. **Check if `estlopacu@gmail.com` is verified**:
   - Look for a green checkmark ‚úÖ next to your email
   - If not verified or not in the list, continue to step 3

3. **Add/Verify Your Email**:
   - Click **"Create New Sender"** or **"Verify Single Sender"**
   - Fill in the form:
     ```
     From Name: Esteban
     From Email Address: estlopacu@gmail.com
     Reply To: estlopacu@gmail.com
     Company Address: Your address
     City: Your city
     Country: Your country
     ```
   - Click **"Create"**
   - Check your Gmail inbox for verification email
   - Click the verification link in the email

### Step 2: Create a New API Key

Your current API key may be expired or have wrong permissions.

1. **Go to API Keys Settings**:
   ```
   https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys
   ```

2. **Create New API Key**:
   - Click **"Create API Key"**
   - Name it: `Freight Delay Notifications`
   - Permission Level: Select **"Full Access"** (recommended) or **"Restricted Access"**
   - If Restricted Access, enable: **Mail Send** ‚Üí **Full Access**
   - Click **"Create & View"**

3. **IMPORTANT - Copy the API Key**:
   - The key will look like: `SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
   - **Copy it immediately** - you won't see it again!
   - It should start with `SG.`

### Step 3: Update Your .env File

Replace the old API key with the new one:

```bash
# Open .env file and update:
SENDGRID_API_KEY="SG.paste_your_new_api_key_here"
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL="estlopacu@gmail.com"
```

### Step 4: Test Again

```bash
npx ts-node src/test-email-client.ts
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ Email sent successfully!

üì¨ Next steps:
   1. Check your inbox at estlopacu@gmail.com
   2. If not in inbox, check spam/junk folder
```
